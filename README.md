# SOC-Detection-Lab â€“ SIEM Implementation

## Objective
The SIEM Implementation project focused on building and configuring a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment to ingest, normalize, and analyze logs.  
The goal was to gain hands-on experience in real-time monitoring, alerting, and threat detection.

## Skills Learned
- Configured log ingestion pipelines for multiple sources
- Built correlation rules and custom alerts
- Analyzed logs to detect anomalous behaviors
- Applied MITRE ATT&CK techniques to test detections
- Developed critical thinking for real-world security incidents

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Splunk
- Elastic Stack
- Wireshark
- PowerShell (for log simulation)
